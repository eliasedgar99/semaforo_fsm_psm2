# semaforo_fsm_psm2
A traffic light control system for STM32 microcontroller using a finite state machine (FSM). It controls two LEDs to simulate green and red lights, allowing pedestrians to request crossing by pressing a button. The FSM handles transitions between green, blinking green, red, and blinking red states, ensuring proper vehicle and pedestrian flow.
